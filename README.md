# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of Project

In this module, we are given a data set of credit card information and our goal is to apply machine learning models to solve the problem: find the best model to predict credit card risk

The challenge for this assignment is that: the number of good loan and the number risk loan is imbalanced. This will cause standard machine learning model does not perform well, as they will learn that the minority class ( risky loan) is not as important as the majority class ( good loan) and put more attention and perform better on the good loan.Thus we will pay attention to resample the dataset, either oversampling or under-sampling it. In this assignment, we used 6 different strategy to resolve this problem.

## Results

### naive random oversampling algorithm

### SMOTE algorithm
